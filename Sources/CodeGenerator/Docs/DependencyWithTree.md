# DependencyWithTree

Combines GASTRee and its dependency
Because we can resolve global references form the `tree` with help of this

``` swift
public struct DependencyWithTree
```

## Initializers

### `init(dependency:tree:)`

``` swift
public init(dependency: Dependency, tree: RootNode)
```

## Properties

### `dependency`

``` swift
let dependency: Dependency
```

### `tree`

``` swift
let tree: RootNode
```
